# The Walking Pet

Hello, my name is Lucas, i'm mobile developer from Brazil and first I apologize for my english, it is not one of the best

I created this application with the idea that it works as a freelance platform for animal caregivers. (actually, it's still in development but okay). After user created account, he can do login and choose if you want to take care of the pet or let your pet be taken care of.
